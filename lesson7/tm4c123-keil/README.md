## Program Overview

This code is written for the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller (Tiva C Series). It demonstrates a simple LED blinking effect using the GPIO peripheral in direct register access mode.

- The **blue LED** is always **ON**.
- The **red LED** **blinks continuously** (turns on and off with a delay loop).
- The **green LED** is not used in this example.

The blinking effect is created by toggling the red LED pin and introducing software delay loops using volatile counters.
